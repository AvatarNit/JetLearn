Types of Machine Learning:
Supervised - labeled data
Unsupervised - finding patterns
Reinforced - learn from mistakes

Types of Machine Learning Problems:
Clasification - Catergorize
Regression - infinte categories
Reccomendation - use the past to predict future

Steps:
1. Gather and load data
2. Data Preprocessing: (Clean Data, convert to numerical)
3. Data Analysis: find input,ouput, and remove rest
4. Define Inputs(Features) and Output(Target) most commonly x & y
5. Split data into testing and training data. Testing 20-25%. Training 75-80%
6. Select best machine learning algrorithm for the problem and train the algorithm
7. perform predicitions and test predictions with real result and calculate accuracy
